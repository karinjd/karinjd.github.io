Abstract: Autonomous underwater robots working with
teams of human divers may need to distinguish between
different divers, e.g., to recognize a lead diver or to follow
a specific team member. This paper describes a technique
that enables autonomous underwater robots to track divers
in real time as well as to reidentify them. The approach is
an extension of Simple Online Realtime Tracking (SORT) with
an appearance metric (deep SORT). Initial diver detection is
performed with a custom CNN designed for realtime diver
detection, and appearance features are subsequently extracted
for each detected diver. Next, realtime tracking-by-detection
is performed with an extension of the deep SORT algorithm.
We evaluate this technique on a series of videos of divers
performing human-robot collaborative tasks and show that
our methods result in more divers being accurately identified
during tracking. We also discuss the practical considerations of
applying multi-person tracking to on-board autonomous robot
operations, and we consider how failure cases can be addressed
during on-board tracking.
