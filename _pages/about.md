I am a Phd candidate in the [Interactive Robotics and Vision Laboratory](http://irvlab.cs.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota, advised by Dr. Junaed Sattar.

Research Interests
------
I have research experience in both cognitive science and computer science, and I'm interested in bridging these two areas of study to create cognitive systems for intelligent agents. I love questions like "How do humans cognitively represent risk, and is it helpful for humans if intelligent agents think about risk in the same way?" and "How can an intelligent agent reason in a way that compliments human reasoning?" 

**Interactive Robotics and Vision Lab**
In the IRV Lab, I work with underwater robots like MinneBot and Loco. I am interested in using computer vision to enable these robots to recognize divers and reason about who those divers are, where they are, and what they are doing. 

**Cognitive Science**
In undergrad I majored in Cognitive Science and Linguistics at Pomona College. During that time, I worked as a reasarch assistant in the Cognitive Aging Lab, the Language Processing Lab, and the Schachter Memory Lab. I wrote my thesis on the cognitive overlap between anxiety and mind wandering.
