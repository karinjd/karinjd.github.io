I am a PhD candidate in the [Interactive Robotics and Vision Laboratory](http://irvlab.cs.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota, advised by Dr. Junaed Sattar.

Research Interests
------
I have research experience in both cognitive science and computer science, and I'm interested in bridging these two areas of study to create cognitive systems for intelligent agents. I love questions like "How do humans cognitively represent risk, and can intelligent agents mimic this representation?" and "How can an intelligent agent communicate with humans in ways that enhance human's natural decision making processes?" 

**Interactive Robotics and Vision Lab**
In the IRV Lab, I work with underwater robots like [MinneBot](http://irvlab.cs.umn.edu/aqua8-minnebot/minnebot-aqua-8-wiki) and [Loco](http://irvlab.cs.umn.edu/other-projects/loco-auv). I am working on enabling these robots to (1) recognize divers and reason about who those divers are and what they are doing, and (2) communicate naturally with divers (i.e. communicate with divers in ways that minimize the added cognitive load for the divers).

My thesis topic involves creating models that intelligent agents can use to represent risk and safety, as well as investigating best practices for intelligent agents when communicating with people about risk. I am currently exploring approaches rooted in probabilistic graphical models that represent unsafe states and contributing factors. 

**Cognitive Science**
In undergrad I majored in Cognitive Science and Linguistics at Pomona College. During that time, I had a lot of fun as a research assistant in some really cool labs:
  * At the Cognitive Agent Lab at Pomona College I helped out with projects investigating tip of the tongue states: those moments when you *know* what word you want to say, but you can't remember what it is. This research investigated lexical phonological activation in older adults.
  * I spent a summer at the Language Processing Lab at Pomona College working on psycholinguistic processing of garden path sentences, which involved learning how to use an eye tracker to analyze how long people focus on individual words while reading.
  * I spent a summer Schachter Memory Lab at Harvard University assisting in projects that investigated the effect of testing during online learning and the link between remembering the past and imaging the future. 
I wrote my thesis on the cognitive overlap between anxiety and mind wandering.
